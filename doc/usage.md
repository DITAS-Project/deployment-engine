# Usage guide

## Concepts

The REST interface and the internal business logic relies in a series of concepts and objects that can be found in `model/model.go` file:

### Input objects

- **Resource:** A resource is a Virtual Machine that needs to be created in a cloud provider. The information that needs to be passed is described in the `ResourceType` struct.
- **Infrastructure:** An infrastructure is a set of resources that need to be created in a particular cloud provider. The required properties are described in `InfrastructureType` struct.
- **Deployment:** A deployment represents an hybrid cloud or cloud-edge deployment formed by one or more infrastructures. For example, a deployment may compromise a set of VMs in AWS's EC2, another one in Google Cloud Platform and several machines already running in an edge location. The required properties are defined in `Deployment` struct.
- **Product:** A product is a software component that needs to be provisioned in one infrastructure. For example, `kubernetes` product will install Kubernetes in a particular infrastructure.

### Output object

- **Node:** A node is a Virtual Machine that has been created and it's running in a cloud provider. It's described in `NodeInfo` struct
- **Infrastructure Deployment:** Just as the input object, it represents a set of nodes that were successfully created in a cloud provider, separated by master and slaves. Each infrastructure has the unique identifier inside the deployment that was provided as input. It's described in `InfrastructureDeploymentInfo` struct.
- **Deployment information:** Represents an hybrid deployment. Just as its counterpart, it contains a list if infrastructures that were created. It's described in `DeploymentInfo` struct.

## REST API

The Deployment Engine provides a default REST interface will listen by default in port 8080 unless configured otherwise (please, see the [installation instructions](installation.md) for the configuration options). The operations provided are:

- `POST /infra`: Creates a new multi-infrastructure deployment with the resources provided in the request body. It returns the deployment information such as VM and Disk IDs and IPs assigned.
- `PUT /infra/{infraId}/{product}`: Provisions a product an infrastructure inside a deployment by providing the deployment and infrastructure identifiers as well as the desired product as path parameters.
- `DELETE /infra/{infraId}`: Removes an infrastructure in a deployment, clearing the resources such as VMs and disks that were allocated. If no more infrastructures remain in the deployment

## Example workflow

### Create a deployment

`POST /infra`
